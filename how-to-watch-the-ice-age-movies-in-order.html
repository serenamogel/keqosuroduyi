The Meltdown massively expanded the cast of characters, introducing Manny’s love interest Ellie (Queen Latifah), as well as her possum pals Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck).

When the continent starts to shift, Manny and his herd are scattered across the sea, where they encounter a gang of piratical critters led by Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage).
