Butterfly, which earned him a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play, as well as other industry-coveted prizes.</p><p>BD is openly gay and has been out for as long as he's been acting. SVU fans will realize he has this in common with his character, Dr. George Huang, but the actor had his reservations with Huang's on-screen coming out.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with NPR</a>, he called the move "a little cheap" and "kind of lazy," and he kind of has a point. "I was also kind of torn because, you know, it's positive," he said on The Cooler podcast. "But it did feel a little convenient or kind of lazy or, you know, kind of not particularly the best way that you want to come out as a character."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>#whiterose or #melania? ‚Äúsomebody hold my earrings that‚Äôs my mama‚Äôs dress you c*rr*pt b*tch!‚Äù #bdbest</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>BD Wong</a> (@wongbd) on Feb 4, 2020 at 2:58pm PST</p></figure><p>"It wasn't a great thing that was really impactful and funny or human or whatever; it was just kind of a minor point made," he continued, adding that he had never been informed his character was gay in the ten and a half years he'd been playing him.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In real life, BD's married, and co-parented his son with his ex.</h2><p>BD's personal life is like a movie. In 1988, he began an almost 20-year relationship with talent manager, executive producer and author Richie Jackson, and the couple had twin sons with BD's sperm and an egg donated by Richie's sister: Boaz Dov and Jackson Foo Wong.</p><p>Boaz died immediately after birth, while Jackson is now 20. After breaking up in 2004, BD co-parented Jackson with Richie and Richie's husband, Jordan Roth. Jackson is gay too, and came out at the age of 15.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It really kinda is the happiest day of your life.
