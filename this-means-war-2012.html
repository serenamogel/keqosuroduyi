Although Reese is not convincing as the woman they go to war over, she would be ideally cast as a straight roommate giving them advice about their romance. Because surely they're gay. They do everything together, ranging from deadly fights on top of a Hong Kong skyscraper to an office contest to see who can shoot the most baskets by tossing wadded-up paper into a wastebasket.</p><p>Here's how creepy it gets. They divert apparently millions of dollars worth of high-tech electronic surveillance equipment to monitor Lauren's private life every moment of the day. This means they can watch each other trying to seduce her and also eavesdrop as she gets advice from Trish (<a href=#>Chelsea Handler</a>), her BFF. Often they review the surveillance videos together. Is there something about that not entirely consistent with a heterosexual competition? Lauren is obviously only the nexus for their plexus.</p><p>The two agents are assigned to the case of Heinrich (<a href=#>Til Schweiger</a>), whose robbery they interrupted in Hong Kong. Their boss at the agency is Collins (<a href=#>Angela Bassett</a>). Heavens, it must grow tiresome to be a big German movie star who's asked only to stand there and look tall, unshaven and menacing. Goodness, Angela Bassett must feel underemployed when asked only to look tall, shaven and menacing. She can play a no-nonsense strong woman as well as anyone, but what can she do with a role that amounts to delivering zingers and stalking off in high heels?</p><p>I've often observed that characters in movies tend to live in nicer apartments than they ought to be able to afford. I don't know what the CIA pays, but FDR has a Los Angeles apartment where the ceiling of a hallway consists of the glass bottom of a swimming pool. Uh, huh.</p><p>Are you asking yourself why his name is FDR? You can be excused for guessing it's short for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but I have a better idea. "This Means War" was directed by a man whose entire and complete name is McG. He's probably always wanted a name he didn't have to explain nine times a day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn6KrXaKyorrSZq6aql1nfXJ%2B</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jose-miguel-vasquez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-45569-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jose Miguel Vasquez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-books-about-inventors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Books About Inventors to Inspire Ingenuity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
