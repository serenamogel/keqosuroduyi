According to the Netflix <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">true-crime</a> documentary, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Can I Tell You a Secret?</a></strong>, that’s what happened to possibly hundreds of women in the U.K., and when those women responded, they fell victim to cyberstalking.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>In the true stories covered in the Netflix two-part series, the messages those women received offering to tell them a secret seemed to come from a woman. For just three women featured in the two-part documentary, the temptation proved too much, and when they responded, they were told rumors that their partners were cheating or that they had been somehow <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">betrayed by people close to them</a>.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>When those women, and potentially hundreds of others, thought better about what they’d done, they were cyberstalked and harassed by a series of fake accounts targeting them and their loved ones.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=194 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, others had fake social media accounts created in their names. And through those accounts, lies were spread, affecting their professional and private lives, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>.</p><h2 id=h-matthew-hardy-was-responsible data-injectable=false>Matthew Hardy was responsible</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>via Netflix/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>At the center of the social media cyberstalking was a man named Matthew Hardy, whose pattern of targeting women online began while he was still in school. In 2022, Hardy was sentenced to nine years in prison for five counts of stalking, when stalking sentences in the U.K. are typically around 17 months. Hardy was arrested several times for cyberstalking before he was finally put behind bars.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>As early as 2010, Hardy was cyberstalking his teenage classmates. One Hardy victim, identified only as Melanie, told The Guardian, “A random person would add me on Facebook and start messaging me. They’d say my boyfriend was cheating on me, and they just wanted to let me know.”</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>Hardy’s cyberstalking was reported, and restraining orders were filed, but Hardy violated them all, while authorities largely ignored his pattern of abuse.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Hardy’s final arrest happened in 2020</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Untitled-design-105.png><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>By 2020, Matthew Hardy’s stalking and harassment escalated to women who didn’t live near him, and even involved contacting one woman through an account claiming to be her grandmother, who had recently died from COVID. Hardy was finally brought to justice with the help of Kevin Anderson of the <a href=#>Chesh</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ire police</a>, who uncovered the years of reported stalking and harassment and found out little had been done to stop it.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>In 2021, Hardy pleaded guilty to involving fear of violence and harassment, and he was sentenced to prison the following year. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Anderson</a>, “[Hardy] would never have stopped … Even on bail, he was still doing it.”</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=false>Can I Tell You a Secret? producer Nancy Strang said that she hopes her show ” … will shed light on the reality of online stalking and change the conversation about what constitutes harm in a digital age.” Strang’s show streams Feb. 21, 2024, on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX5iur3nIZquepJxixrDBjJpkrJ2Tp7K1ec2eq5%2Bkma16tb7UnmSsrJ%2Bnxm6x16mjmqGemrFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-marzia-kjellberg-and-where-is-she-now-is-she-still-married-to-pewdiepie-294530-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to Marzia Kjellberg And Where Is She Now?
