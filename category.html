I don’t care if they’re trendy or not, the good fat that you get from avocados always makes for a delicious, nutrient-dense meal or mid-day snack. In an effort not to show you yet another version of avocado toast – I have the next best thing – the avocado tostada. It’s like avocado toast in disguise.

They’re the main ingredient in this easy recipe, along with a few staples that you likely already have in your kitchen. Carrot Soup Recipe Ingredients This easy soup recipe is just 7 ingredients, and it’s so simple&nbsp;and delicious&nbsp;with no cream, no cashew cream, and no coconut cream (ok just a tad for garnish, but it’s really not necessary). The creamy base of the soup comes purely from the pureed carrots.

I suppose on-demand or Netflixed cartoons are probably more convenient, but I am&nbsp;still sad to hear the news. Growing up (without cable), Saturday morning cartoons were what my sister and I looked forward to all week. Pancakes, cereal commercials, the whole bit. Jack and I still have a weekend ritual – although our&nbsp;“cartoon”&nbsp;is&nbsp;Shark Tank instead of Muppet Babies, and&nbsp;our breakfast is usually&nbsp;eggs instead of pancakes. This recipe&nbsp;is a great “use up what you have” kind of breakfast.

No, I don’t have any new book or baby announcements on the agenda – but today&nbsp;is the first day in four years that this vegetarian food blog has a lentil recipe! I have at least 39 chickpea recipes (more if you count the ones I probably forgot to tag) but&nbsp;let me present – the almighty lentil. I realize that many of you probably really love lentils… they’re a great source of protein, especially if you’re vegan or vegetarian. My&nbsp;relationship with lentils has been so-so, but lately I’ve been giving them another chance.&nbsp;So far, I’ve…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This Tuscan white bean soup recipe grew out of Jack’s new weekend hobby: bread-making. Over the last few weeks, he’s made some really delicious focaccia and a few loaves of ciabatta which, I have to tell you, were super impressive. I previously had this idea that rustic crusty bread would require wood-fired ovens and other non-household equipment to make. It doesn’t. The ingredients are simple, but it does require an afternoon’s worth of babysitting. Knead, fold, wait, rest… repeat… like 15 more times. After all of this&nbsp;hard work, when the last chunk of ciabatta went stale&nbsp;a few days later, I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I’m slowly becoming a baked potato lover, but not just any baked potato lover. I still can’t get behind white baked potatoes slathered with sour cream and butter, but I could&nbsp;eat these mega stuffed sweet potatoes for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Case in point, as I started writing&nbsp;this post, I went and polished off the leftovers I was saving for my lunch…&nbsp;for breakfast. I’m telling you, I have no self-control sometimes. A good stuffed sweet potato, of course, starts with the “stuff.” I made my filling by mixing black beans with corn, Cotija cheese, avocado, jalapeño, and generous squeezes of…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I made a lot of things with pumpkin over the&nbsp;weekend&nbsp;– not just because it’s the cliché fall food blogger thing to do, but because I roasted one&nbsp;pumpkin and cooked from it for days! It was the roasted pumpkin that kept on giving… I’ll admit that when it comes to pumpkin I often reach for a can, but the flavor and texture that come from a&nbsp;fresh pumpkin are really worth it. I made pumpkin hummus, pumpkin salad, pumpkin soup… and of course the&nbsp;pumpkin coconut red curry sauce that is pictured here.

In&nbsp;an effort to feel some&nbsp;“fall spirit,” I roasted&nbsp;chickpeas and carrots and tossed those in too. Cooked carrots haven’t always been our thing – the trick is to roast them until they’re slightly tender but still have some bite (just don’t let them get mushy!).

I never thought I would say this but after shooting, testing, retesting, checking and rechecking so many&nbsp;recipes&nbsp;– I became a little “cooked” out.&nbsp;Over the last few weeks, while working through final copy and design edits, there’s been a lot of takeout around here and more than a few boxes of macaroni and cheese.

I love making a big batch of a soup or stew on Sunday and eating it all week. This butternut squash vegan chili recipe is my current Sunday soup obsession. It’s hearty and healthy, warming and slightly spicy.&nbsp;Plus, it’s one of those soups that gets a little better every day, so unlike most leftovers, I loved&nbsp;eating this chili for lunch just about every afternoon last week.

Fall is in the air, and although&nbsp;it’s not exactly crisp outside here, I’ve made crisp inside to make up for it. Apple crisp is hands down my favorite fall dessert. I love apple pie too, but I love it more when other people make it for me.&nbsp;This vegan apple crisp recipe is simple and straightforward&nbsp;– you can&nbsp;mix everything&nbsp;together and get these little guys&nbsp;into the oven in no time. (You can even mix the crumble part ahead of time). To make these vegan, I used coconut oil instead of butter and scooped vegan ice cream on top.
