He also has a cocky, upbeat speed (see "Bread and Roses"), but since "<a href=#>The Pianist</a>," directors have used him for mournfulness. He has a lot to mourn this time. After being declared dead in Iraq, it's discovered he's alive after all, and Jack is returned to the States and treated for amnesia. Out on his own, he's hitching through Vermont when he comes upon a spaced-out mother (<a href=#>Kelly Lynch</a>) and her worried young daughter; their car has broken down. After helping them, he gets a lift with a passing motorist, who soon enough kills a cop. Jack passes out and wakes up to find himself a convicted cop-killer, sent to a mental asylum. If only he could find that woman and daughter, he could establish an alibi. But the woman was zoned out, and the daughter was only a child.</p><p>The asylum is not one of your modern and enlightened asylums. Edgar Allan Poe would raise his eyebrows. It's run by Dr. Becker (<a href=#>Kris Kristofferson</a>), whose theories are a cover for his sadism, or maybe it's the other way around. He believes that locking cold and wet patients in morgue drawers for long hours will help them, I dunno, get in touch with their feelings, or remember why they're there. Who knows.</p><p>The movie now begins to play with time. In a gas station, Jack, forlorn and homeless, is befriended by a woman named Jackie (<a href=#>Keira Knightley</a>, from "<a href=#>Bend It Like Beckham</a>"). She takes him home, cares for him, and here's where we have to get crafty to preserve plot points. To make a long plot short, when he is in the morgue drawer, Jack's brain, traumatized by a head wound, amnesia and shock treatments, is able to time-travel. Or maybe Jack himself physically time travels; the people who meet him on his journeys certainly think he's really there.</p><p>It's up to Jackie to believe this story, and act on it, so that Jack can use his knowledge of the future to make important decisions in the present. Or maybe it's in the future that he makes the decisions, and in the past that he carried them out. Take notes. Able to assist him, if she believes his story, is Dr. Lorenson (<a href=#>Jennifer Jason Leigh</a>) and even the evil retired Dr. Becker himself. Lorenson always looked askance at Becker's barbaric methods. Try it yourself sometime, looking askance. Can be fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lmpawrLHTZmlpaGU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kiki-layne.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Old Guard's Actor, KiKi Layne Is Living A Single Life Now.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./randy-martin-passed-away-at-the-age-of-65.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Randy Martin Passed Away At The Age Of 65</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
