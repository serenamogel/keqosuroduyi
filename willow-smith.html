After acting in a few projects, in 2010 Smith released a song, "Whip My Hair," that became a hit single. However, the demands of fame eventually stressed the young Smith to the point that she took a step away from performing. Smith later started making music as WILLOW. She overcame <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.standard.co.uk/insider/willow-smith-interview-es-magazine-will-smith-b953459.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="personal doubts" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">personal doubts</a> and embraced her lifelong love of rock to release the album Lately I Feel Everything (2021). In doing so, she staked her own claim to a genre of music with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vogue.com/article/willow-smith-grow-video-avril-lavigne-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="strong ties to the Black community" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">strong ties to the Black community</a>. In addition to music, Smith co-hosts the popular talk show Red Table Talk with her mother and grandmother.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Family</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Willow Camille Reign Smith was born on October 31, 2000, in Los Angeles, California. Smith is the daughter of Hollywood stars Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. She has an older brother, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jaden-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jaden Smith" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jaden Smith</a>, and an older half-brother, Trey Smith. Her family's status meant Smith was raised in the spotlight.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Acting and Music</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2007, Smith had a role alongside her father in the movie I Am Legend. She next appeared in Kit Kittredge: An American Girl (2008) and joined her mother to voice a character in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (2008). She was also seen on the television show True Jackson, VP. As a teen, Smith performed vocally in Neo Yokio and Adventure Time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Smith's first pop single, "Whip My Hair," came out when she was 9 years old. The song was a hit, ultimately going platinum and reaching No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2010, Smith signed a recording contract with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jay-z data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Jay-Z class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jay-Z</a>'s Roc Nation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Smith had some follow-up success with songs like 2011's "21st Century Girl," but nothing was as popular as "Whip My Hair." She also came to dislike the pressure-filled lifestyle of performing. In 2012, Smith shaved her head during her "Whip My Hair" tour, an act of protest against continuing. She also decided she didn't want to take on the title role in a filmed version of the musical Annie that her father was producing. Smith has<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/willow-smith-used-to-cut-herself/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" admitted" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> admitted</a> she later started cutting herself in an attempt to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/willow-smith-opens-up-about-self-harm-and-why-she-stopped-cutting-herself/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" deal with her emotional pain" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> deal with her emotional pain</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Smith<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/willow-smith-had-forgive-dad-will-over-early-fame/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" told" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> told</a> Pinkett Smith in 2018, "I definitely had to forgive you and Daddy for that whole 'Whip My Hair' thing. It was mostly Daddy because he was so harsh at certain times." Reflecting on her childhood career, in 2019 she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/willow-smith-opens-up-about-self-harm-and-why-she-stopped-cutting-herself/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a> magazine, "I was super young, and I had a dream, but all I really wanted to do was sing and I didn't equate that with all the business and the stress that ended up coming with it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though she'd rebelled against the demands on her, Smith didn't stop making music. Her debut album, Ardipithecus, was released in 2015. Her next two albums, The 1st and Willow, came out in 2017 and 2019 respectively.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Red Table Talk'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Smith, her mother and her maternal grandmother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, had a tradition of<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/jada-pinkett-smith-interview-red-table-talk-willow-smith-1127056/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" sharing" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> sharing</a> personal stories and insights among themselves. Pinkett Smith recorded and released one of these no-barriers, intergenerational conversations in 2013. Five years later, the women launched their own talk show, Red Table Talk, on Facebook Watch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Red Table Talk has an informal set-up that harkens back to the family's earlier discussions. On the show, the three generations of women have tackled topics such as mental health, politics and sexuality.

Along with the album, Smith and Cole took part in a performance art piece. Inside a glass box at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, they spent 24 hours embodying eight different emotional states linked to anxiety.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a teenager, Smith had developed a<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.whowhatwear.com/willow-smith-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" love" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> love</a> of rock while listening to groups like My Chemical Romance and Blink-182. Those influences were evident in her next album, Lately I Feel Everything, which came out in July 2021. The album, produced with Cole, is seen as pop-punk, though Smith has<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.standard.co.uk/insider/willow-smith-interview-es-magazine-will-smith-b953459.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" clarified" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> clarified</a>, "I knew I didn't want to do a completely pop-punk record, I knew that it needed to have a mixture of some moody alternative, more melodic vibes because that's just who I am."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Smith has stated that Lately I Feel Everything is the kind of record she'd wanted to make <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/music/willow-smith-felt-a-lot-of-pressure-following-parents-footsteps/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"since I was literally 12,"' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">"since I was literally 12,"</a> but she'd been<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.whowhatwear.com/willow-smith-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" hesitant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> hesitant</a> about diving into this genre of music.
