Myron’s life may have been tragically cut short, but his impact on the world and the lives he touched will forever endure in our hearts and memories. Born on May 21, 2002, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Myron brought joy and warmth into the lives of his parents, Alicia Rogers and Myron Snyder. His journey began there, and it was one filled with promise, dreams, and aspirations.</p><p>Myron was an outstanding individual who graduated from Washington High School in 2020. His dedication and love for his community were evident through his work at the Boys and Girls Club. His journey with the club began at the tender age of six, and for the next seven years, he continued to make a positive impact on the young lives he touched. As a part of the Sports, Recreation, and Fitness program at the Boys and Girls Club, Myron displayed a strong commitment to health and fitness. He instilled the values of physical well-being, discipline, and teamwork in the children he mentored.</p><p>Myron’s dedication didn’t stop there. With his passion for fishing, he introduced a new BGC fishing club, which quickly became a favorite among the children. His love for teaching and their enthusiasm for learning formed a unique bond that the kids will forever cherish. Myron’s legacy also extends to the world of technology and innovation. He was the driving force behind the Robotics STEM Program, an initiative that opened up new horizons for countless young minds. His commitment to education and the pursuit of knowledge was unwavering. In addition to his remarkable professional achievements, Myron’s warm and infectious smile lit up even the darkest days. He was a young man full of determination, dedication, and a heart that brimmed with love for those around him. His charismatic presence could brighten any room and make people feel at ease.</p><p>As we gather to remember Myron, it’s important to acknowledge the love and support he received from his family, who were the cornerstone of his life. He is survived by his parents, Alicia and Myron, and his siblings, Mikhel, JaeCis, Javion, Mekhi, and Ashanta. Myron’s extended family included his grandmother, Vornada Snyder, grandfather, David Phelps, and numerous aunts, uncles, and other relatives who held a special place in his heart. He also had a devoted godmother, Esoterica Jones of Georgia, and a long-time mentor, Lorinda Ampey. Myron’s journey was touched by tragedy, as he was preceded in death by his grandmothers, Linda Rogers and Mary Phelps, along with his great-grandparents, Lawyer and Lula Rogers, Rose Mere, and Lovie Walton. While we grieve his untimely departure, we also remember the loved ones who preceded him in the journey of life.</p><p>In keeping with Myron’s spirit of giving and dedication to his community, memorial contributions may be directed to Dupaco Community Credit Union. These donations will undoubtedly continue the legacy of love and support that Myron epitomized throughout his life. Myron Snyder’s memory is a testament to the indelible mark one person can leave on the lives of those around them. His dedication, passion, and warm smile will forever be cherished, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of all who were fortunate enough to know him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKWpp7yvedKnsJ2domK8o7XTrpirsV2WerG%2BxJygqK2jYsCwwctmnqimlWLBsLuMrKaopl8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rabbit-hole-2010.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rabbit Hole movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2010)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meg-deangelis-net-worth-207884.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meg DeAngelis Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
