This, as per a Japanese family, was the best career success story.</p><p>However, this wasn’t enough for Mikitani. When he was sent to the United States in 1993, he earned an MBA from Harvard Business School, the world’s greatest business school.</p><p>Despite working for three more years at the Industrial Bank of Japan after that, he always knew he wanted to strike out independently.</p><p>He pursued a long-held ambition “to build an internet shopping company,” which was considered dangerous in the 1990s when e-commerce was still in its infancy.</p><p>As a result, Mikitani believed that internet buying only needed “another chance” and “the appropriate technique to do it.”</p><h2>Hiroshi Mikitani’s Net Worth and Income</h2><p><strong>A Japanese CEO and co-founder of Rakuten, Hiroshi Mikitani’s net worth is a staggering $9 billion as of 2023.</strong></p><p>As the CEO and Chairman of Rakuten, a Japanese electronic commerce and Internet company that he created in 1997, Mikitani has amassed a net worth of $6.1 billion.</p><p>He changed the company’s name to Rakuten, Inc. after two years. He is also the head of the Development Units and the E-Commerce and Banking Business Units.</p><p>Moreover, he is still looking for more companies to buy to expand his global services and compete with major internet retailers like Amazon and eBay.</p><p>Similarly, he considers English to be a must rather than an advantage. He purchased a $100 million stake in the photo-sharing site Pinterest in May 2012 and a $100 million holding in Kobo, Canada’s e-book reader startup, earlier that year.</p><p>In addition, He has recently benefitted from internet deregulation, with the lifting of limitations on online drug sales and election campaigning. This means he’ll be able to make more money in Japan.</p><p>Also, he was a director of Kobo Inc. and the chairman of&nbsp; Rakuten Travel Inc., Rakuten Card Co., Ltd., and Fusion Communications Corp., among other positions.</p><h2>Hiroshi Mikitani’s Net Worth in Different Currencies</h2><p>Let’s look at Hiroshi Mikitani’s Net Worth in several currencies, including BitCoin, the cryptocurrency.</p><table class=mytable width=696><tbody><tr><td><strong>Currency</strong></td><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Euro</strong></td><td>€ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":840399999.9999999}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDEUR")*R[-1]C[-1]'>840,400,000</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pound Sterling</strong></td><td>£ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":715695000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDGBP")*R[-2]C[-1]'>715,695,000</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Australian Dollar</strong></td><td>A$ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":1350895000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDAUD")*R[-3]C[-1]'>1,350,895,000</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Canadian Dollar</strong></td><td>C$&nbsp;<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":9974800}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDCAD")*R[-4]C[-1]'>9,974,800</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Indian Rupee</strong></td><td>₹&nbsp;<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":594036000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDINR")*R[-5]C[-1]'>594,036,000</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>BitCoin</strong></td><td>฿&nbsp;<span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":197.83936}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDBTC")*R[-6]C[-1]'>198</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Hiroshi Mikitani: House</h2><p>As luxury costs rise, billionaire Mikitani constructs a new Tokyo home.</p><p>Hiroshi Mikitani, Japan’s fourth richest man, is developing a residence in central Tokyo that is expected to cost at least 2.3 billion dollars, highlighting a luxury property shortage in the city.</p><p>According to the sources, the two-story house is on an 880-square-meter plot in an affluent Shibuya Ward neighborhood. 21 Sky Realty, land prices in the area have increased by 20% this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hiroshi-mikitanis-house-from-googlemao.jpg><p>Mikitani purchased the land in February 2011 for an undisclosed sum.

The company was formed in 1997 by Hiroshi Mikitani.</p><p>Also, the company’s revenues were $4.7 billion in 2012, with an operating profit of around US$770 million. The site’s 48-year-old founder is worth $8 billion, making him Japan’s third wealthiest individual.</p><p>This is how he developed the Rakuten empire. Hiroshi Mikitani is a very wealthy man with an estimated net worth of $8 billion.</p><h2>Rakuten, Banking, Sports team ownership, Banking, Keidanren, Book Publication</h2><h3>Rakuten</h3><p>It requires guts to believe in and put money into a futuristic concept. In an era when it was difficult to predict how huge online retailing would grow, Rakuten seized the internet retail industry by storm.</p><p>The crew was adamant about their concept and refused to give up. Even though everyone said that no one would buy items through the internet, this wonderful organization worked hard.</p><p>Hiroshi Mikitani created Rakuten in 1997 when it was known as MDM, Inc. In 1999, the name was finally changed. ‘Rakuten’ is a Japanese term that signifies ‘hopefulness.’ Mikitani is still the company’s CEO. The concept was novel and risky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hiroshi-ceo-of-rakuten-1024x682.jpg><p>Despite this, Hiroshi was persuaded to create Rakuten following his first online buying experience. His order for Japanese noodles arrived in the mail after he ordered them from a small local business.</p><p>Following this encounter, he realized that internet buying would become a commonplace pastime within a few years and decided to take advantage of the opportunity.</p><p>Travel, online shopping, e-books, banking, credit cards, and the Rakuten Golden Eagles baseball franchise are Rakuten’s business units.</p><p>While Honda president Takanobu Ito condemned the concept as “ridiculous” in 2010, Mikitani argues that “English is no longer a benefit — it is a must.”</p><h3>Banking</h3><p>Mikitani was employed for the Industrial Bank of Japan (now Mizuho Corporate Bank) from 1988 to 1996, with a break for Harvard Business School from 1991 to 1993.</p><p>He quit forming Crimson Group, his own consulting firm. Mikitani has stated that the disastrous 1995 Kobe earthquake inspired him to want to revitalize Japan’s economy.</p><p>As a result, it led to his retirement from banking and his choice to create his own company.</p><h3>Keidanren</h3><p>In 2004, Mikitani became a member of Keidanren, a significant Japanese business group.</p><p>Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, he resigned from the federation, announcing it on Twitter before sending in his formal resignation letter.</p><p>In detail, it stated that it was no longer the same organization he had joined and that he disagreed with its support for continued reliance on nuclear power. Later, he considered forming a rival organization.</p><p>Furthermore, the <strong>Japanese Association of New Economy</strong> (JANE) began operations in Tokyo on June 1, 2012. The “Japan e-business association,” which had been founded in February 2010, was renamed to include non-online enterprises.</p><h3>Book Publications</h3><p>The CEO of the world’s third-largest e-commerce company admits to breaking the rules.</p><p>Mikitani, the founder and CEO of Rakuten, shares his perspective on violating rules and thinking differently to succeed in the global marketplace in his books.</p><p>As of now, he has authored three different books:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>The Power to Complete</strong></a>,<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong> Principles for Success</strong></a>, and <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Marketplace 3.0</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hiroshi-books-673x1024.jpg><p>Mikitani explains how true employee empowerment, suppliers, and consumers are essential to establishing a healthy corporate culture and mindset.</p><p>Also, maintain a position in the international market; and how the element of joy is vital in changing the rules of entrepreneurship.</p><p>In detail, while the book might be self-congratulatory at times and repetitious or in need of rewriting at others.</p><p>Mikitani weaves an amazing entrepreneur story and makes a compelling case for breaking boundaries.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>After a year as an independent consultant, he founded ‘Rakuten’ (which means optimism in Japanese) with a few other young people in 1997.</p><p>Rakuten quickly rose to become Japan’s largest and most successful e-commerce site, with international expansion. Hiroshi Mikitani didn’t stop at e-commerce.</p><p>He is presently the chairman of Rakuten Travels, Crimson Football Club, Director of Kobo Inc, and Director of Priceminister S.A.S.</p><p>Moreover, he has not only realized his aim of creating the ideal e-commerce company, but he has also risen to become one of Japan’s most powerful CEOs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hiroshi-mikitani-ceo.jpg><p>Also, he has been granted the Legion of Honour, which the French government bestows on the world’s greatest accomplishments, at the age of 51.</p><p>Hiroshi was also honored with the Harvard Business School Alumni Achievement Award, a rare honor. Hiroshi, on the other hand, still has a long way to go in terms of accomplishments.</p><p>Furthermore, Hiroshi Mikitani now blogs and provides motivational presentations about his accomplishments and the path to success in business.</p><p>For his followers, he has three mantras: “follow your passion,” “don’t be scared to start small,” and “be open to change.” He attributes his achievement to these three factors, according to him.</p><h2>Controversy</h2><p>After the release of a film featuring them over the weekend, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele of Barcelona have been embroiled in a dispute.</p><p>While on tour with Barça in 2019, Dembele appears to make fun of several Japanese workers in the video, which Griezmann laughs.</p><p>Following the video’s release, both players apologized for their behavior but insisted that their comments had no racist overtones.</p><p>On Tuesday, however, Hiroshi Mikitani, the CEO of Rakuten, Barça’s biggest sponsor, expressed his displeasure with the film and sought a reaction from the Catalan club.</p><p>According to RAC1, Griezmann and Dembele have both contacted Barça to apologize for their mistakes and express regret for what can be heard in the video.</p><p>Griezmann emerges as a Manchester City alternative to Kane. Moreover, according to the same article, he has apparently personally phoned Mikitani to apologize for the video.
