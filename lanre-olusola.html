Never start something you are not ready to finish.”</p><p>“Courage is not what we’ve been taught. Courage is taking<br>small and deliberate determined actions, in spite of your fear or shortcomings.<br>Create your own courage today.”</p><p>“…Face your fears and limitations and defeat them by taking little steps per time. By the time you look back to join the dots, you’ve become a conqueror.”</p><p>“You can do anything if you BELIEVE and PRACTICE.”</p><p>“You must first love God and accept His love for you,<br>without this you can’t know what love really is and you can’t give it.”</p><p>“Go out there today and every day – Live to Love; Love to Live for yourself and others.”</p><p>“…LOVE is a genuine dedicated commitment towards the<br>wellbeing of another.”</p><h4>More Quotes</h4><p>“REPENT from killing and destroying people unknowingly through your unbelieving thoughts, words, and deeds.”</p><p>“Life is about dreaming and aspiring. Life is about transcendency and helping others attain their dreams. Believing and hoping the BEST in others is the key to their success.”</p><p>“…We should stop talking about change if we all can’t stay<br>and speak one voice and sacrifice for the next generation.”</p><p>“Perception is everything. Your perception is stronger than reality, your perception is your own reality. The way you see the problem is the problem.”</p><p>“Have a vision, anticipate all that can stop you and put contingency plans in place! A vision gives you current sight, foresight, insight, and hindsight.”</p><p>Nobody ever had it smooth all the way. Success is never a function of luck or chance. It requires time and practice. Success is the reward for hard work.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1foa6vvsRmpqWto6S5ons%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./antonia-lofaso-daughter-husband-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Chef Antonia Lofaso's Daughter Xeya Born from Her Relationship With Late Rapper Heavy D?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dilraba-dilmurat-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dilraba Dilmurat Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
