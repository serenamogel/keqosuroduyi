The couple fell in love and then tied the knot on 21 April 2014, in a private ceremony in Italy.</span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2020/apr/ranimukerjiaditya11587463900.jpg alt="Rani Mukerji Aditya" width=616 height=463 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><span>Recently, in an interview, Rani shared that she fell for Aditya because he was such a private person. Talking about the same to a news channel, Rani said that if Aditya was to be like Karan Johar, she would have not have fallen in love with him. According to her, Karan is everywhere, he is so social and he is the life of a party. Every day he is doing something or the other. She needs her family at home. She revealed that she is a very family-oriented person and she would go mad if her husband was busy working half the time and having a social life in the other half.<br></span><p><span>Rani also mentioned that she is happy that Aditya is not a social person. After his work, he comes back home to her. Elaborating further she said that for her, after being in the industry for so many years, he was the one person she really respected. She finds it difficult to respect people in the fraternity as one knows the inside and out of everything. So, Aditya was one of those rare people whom she'd respect and still does, because of his ethos, work pattern and the way he is. She also added that because she too is a private person, it makes them a really good and happy couple.</span></p><p><span>We wish Rani and Adi many many years of happiness together!</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2020/apr/ranimukerjiaditya21587463906.jpg alt="Rani Mukerji Aditya" width=616 height=345 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> More on: <a href=#><span>Rani Mukerji Aditya</span></a> <a style=text-decoration:none class="row drops" onclick='showCommentBox("1",40342)' href=#><h2 class="commentsCount clearfix"><span>SHOW COMMENTS</span></h2><span id=commentCount40342 class="expand-i pull-right"></span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XLpp2aqpVjsLC5jqecsKtfl7ytuNiwpqicX6m1qr%2BMoqpmr5iuerOtzaJkpq2bmr%2BrtYyfnKWkXZ67brjOr5xmr5mptW6tw6KrspldmLWwvNGaZG1oY2l%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-20-best-frankenstein-films-ranked.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 20 best Frankenstein films ranked! | Film</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dr-seuss-ice-cream-party-icecreamtreat.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dr. Seuss Ice Cream Party!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
