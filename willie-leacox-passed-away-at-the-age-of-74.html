Unknown factors led to his death at his Stockton, California, residence.</h3><p>We are devastated to hear about the passing of Willie Leacox, our adored drummer of 41 years. We value the time we spent with Willie on this crazy journey because he was a significant part of the American family.</p><p>Additionally, the story urged anyone who wishes to donate in Willie’s honor to do so to the Leacox Family Music Education Scholarship.</p><h2>Willie Leacox’s life and work</h2><p>He was given the name William Robert Leacox and was born into a musical household of drummers. His father, sibling, uncle, and three cousins were all drummers growing up. Willie developed an early passion for playing the drums. He played in numerous bands throughout primary and high school.</p><p>He majored in piano and played the drums in several undergraduate ensembles at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas, where he received his bachelor’s degree in music in 1970. To boost his income, Leacox continued to play in bands; he was a part of the group Jerms.</p><p>After graduating from college, Willie relocated to Southern California where he worked as a free dancer, with area artists, and in the music industry.</p><p>He later encountered actor and singer David Joloff, who suggested that he immigrate to America. Joloff’s apartment was near to the residences of Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnell, and Gerry Beckley in the United States, and he learned that they were organizing an audition to find a new drummer.</p><p>At the audition, Willie won over the judges in America, and he was hired straight away. He had pleasant memories of working on the vacation with Sir George Martin because it was his first LP.</p><p>Then, he contributed to all of Martin’s tracks on the drums, including a live album that was captured at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. He also suggested GonBops congas, Vic Firth sticks, RhythmTech percussion, MAY E.A. internal mic devices, Sabian cymbals, and Ludwig drums.</p><p>As a well-known and skilled percussionist, Willie was well-known in the music industry. As news of his death spread, Twitter was flooded with condolences. When America released a statement on Leacox’s passing, it was chock-full of tributes from fans, including remarks from actor John Stamos that he was a drummer he greatly respected. He was described as a superb drummer and a talented musician by others.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Eniko Hart And Her Parents, Especially Her Mother, Are Very Close</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Drummer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kris Myers</a></h3>Kris Myers estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
