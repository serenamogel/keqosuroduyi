You can lecture them, to no point, and plead with them, to no avail, but essentially an outsider is powerless over someone else's addiction. Downey is clearly out of control and headed for bottom. He has lost the recording studio, spent all his money, made a halfhearted stab at a rehab center, gone back to using and been banished from his home by his father, who practices tough love and tells him, "You can lead your life anyway you want, but stay the hell out of mine."</p><p>The first hint of this movie's power comes during a Christmas party scene. McCarthy, back from the East, tries to talk to his old friend and his former girlfriend, but they're stoned and talk too fast and too loud, almost mechanically, and have tiny attention spans. Later, Gertz begs McCarthy to help Downey, but what can he do? And then the movie's long middle section functions almost as a documentary of the Beverly Hills fast track, of private clubs that open at midnight, of expensive cars and smooth drug dealers and glamorous hangers-on, and the quiet desperation of a society of once-bright, once-attractive, once-promising young people who talk about a lot of things but essentially think only about cocaine.</p><p>The movie's three central performances are flawless: Gertz, as the frightened girl who witnesses the disintegration of her friend; McCarthy, as the quiet, almost cold witness from outside this group, and especially by Downey, whose acting here is so real, so subtle and so observant that it's scary.</p><p>His life in the film revolves around the will of a fourth character, his drug dealer (<a href=#>James Spader</a>). He owes the dealer $50,000 and has no money and no prospects, and the most frightening thing about his situation is that the Spader character is actually fairly reasonable, as these characters go. "I'm not the problem," Spader tells McCarthy. "Julian is the problem." He has extended much more credit than he would usually permit, out of "friendship," but now Downey is at the end of the line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lnKyrXam1orqMs5yrp11mhnmD</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tyler-james-williams-girlfriend-wife-abbott-elementary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyler James Williams Girlfriend Or Wife: Is Abbott Elementary Cast Married?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sesame-cucumber-salad-mustard-seeds.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sesame Cucumber Salad with Pickled Mustard Seeds</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
