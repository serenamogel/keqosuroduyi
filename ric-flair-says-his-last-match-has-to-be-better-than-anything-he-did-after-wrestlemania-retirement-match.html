He would later wrestle for Impact Wrestling, where he fought The Icon Sting, which many thoughts were his last match. Now that The Nature Boy is wrestling his supposed last match at Starrcast V, Flair has proclaimed that it needs to be better than what he’s done since losing to Michaels.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Connor Casey of ComicBook</a>, Flair discussed having high expectations for the match on July 31st. Check out what The Nature Boy had to say below:</p><p><strong>It has to be really good, it has to be better than anything I did after Shawn Michaels. It’s not about the money. It’s all about re-establishing the fact I have my self-confidence. It’s never been higher. Back then, at that time, I was still having self-confidence issues and I was paying out (for his divorces) more to three people and had to go to work. Now I don’t have to do anything. But it gave me a goal. I’ve been working out. Kelly (Brewster) and I worked together, as partners in this (his upcoming comic book series) but she also trains with me and it’s a lot of hard work. We drive 45 miles up to John Cena’s place in the morning for an hour and a half. And then we go down to Saint Peak to training like there’s no tomorrow for two hours and it’s a lot more fun for me if I have someone to compete against.</strong></p><p>Ric Flair’s last match is being promoted under Jim Crockett Promotions. There has been chatter that Flair would be teaming with FTR to take on The Rock N’ Roll Express and a mystery partner in a six-man-tag match. At one point, Ricky ‘The Dragon’ Steamboat was rumored to be wrestling Flair, but news recently revealed that Steamboat turned it down due to a money issue.</p><p>What do you make of The Nature Boy’s comments about his supposed final match?
