Well, we ordered all of their prepared menu items, from 7-Eleven <a href=#>hot dogs</a> to <a href=#>chicken strips</a> to something called a “buffalo chicken roller,” and made one sad little Sporked writer (aka me) eat all the hot 7-Eleven food in one sitting. Oh, the things we do for our readers. (Someone send a <a href=#>green juice</a>, please.)</p><p>Let’s go on a journey. A journey to your local 7-Eleven. Walk in, and you’ll see <a href=#>taquitos</a> and hot dogs spinning on rollers like a carnival stand. Slices of pizza laid out for you to grab and go. Chicken, in its various forms, ripe for the plucking. It’s a veritable feast—if you’re a broke college student stumbling in at 2 a.m. For everyone else, 7-Eleven food is a questionable form of sustenance that, hey, may or may not just have a bad rep. That’s why we’re here, putting it to the test.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me be a little dramatic for a second: I’m glad, at the end of the day, my company provides me with health insurance. If your company doesn’t provide you with health insurance, I don’t recommend buying all of the hot food at 7-Eleven and eating it in one sitting. (Maybe you could do all the 7-Eleven taquitos and be fine, but seriously, don’t push it.) Of the 13 hot foods we ordered from our local 7-Eleven, six were good enough to recommend for your next desperate, late-night convenience store run.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#8a7a4f></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best 7-Eleven Hot Foods" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_7-eleven-hot-foods_inset-06.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best 7-Eleven Food</p><strong>7-Eleven Roasted Chicken Wings</strong><p>When I opened the box of 7-Eleven chicken wings, the sight spooked me. They looked like bland chicken wings that had been sitting out on a potluck table for too long. (In a way, that’s not too far off from the reality of the situation.) But, honestly? These were surprisingly moist, tender, and nicely salted. I actually came back for bites of these a few times as a palette cleanser, so that should tell you something. While I can’t recommend these against wings you would find at Wingstop or other popular chains, I would say these are on par with good <a href=#>frozen chicken wings</a>. For 7-Eleven hot foods, they definitely aren’t bad.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#687c50></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best 7-Eleven Hot Foods" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_7-eleven-hot-foods_inset-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best 7-Eleven Food</p><strong>7-Eleven Chicken Strips</strong><p>I expected the 7-Eleven Chicken Strips to taste like cardboard. And, yeah, I was kinda right. But again, what do you expect? A miracle? We’re talking about 7-Eleven food, here. The breading is the best part. It’s crispy and very peppery, and imbues the meat with a zesty flavor that keeps things interesting. The chicken was pretty tender and not dry. I would absolutely eat a full box of these—and I bet you would, too.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#797e48></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best 7-Eleven Hot Foods" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_7-eleven-hot-foods_inset-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best 7-Eleven Food</p><strong>7-Eleven</strong> <strong>Cheeseburger Bite</strong><p>Story time! When our 7-Eleven food delivery made it to the office, none of the menu items were labeled. We had to determine what we were eating by process of elimination. There was one item in particular that was stumping us. It looked, well…like a charred turd in a hot dog bun. (You can see it pictured left.) Eventually I realized it was the 7-Eleven Cheeseburger Bite (a confusing name), which is basically a burger patty in the shape of a thick hot dog, infused with <a href=#>cheddar cheese</a> and charred a bit on the outside. If I were grading on presentation alone, this 7-Eleven hot food would be dead last. But ultimately this thing was juicy, super savory, and pretty tender. It reminded me of a <a href=#>bratwurst</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#587b51></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best 7-Eleven Hot Foods" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_7-eleven-hot-foods_inset-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best 7-Eleven Food</p><strong>7-Eleven Jalapeño & Cheese Taquito</strong><p>There’s a wide variety of 7-Eleven taquitos perched nice and pretty behind the glass display, and you know what? None of them are bad. Should the exterior be crispier? Yes. Could they be a bit hotter when they come off the rollers? Sure. But for a quick snack on the go, they totally do the job. Their Jalapeño & Cheese Taquito is particularly creative. With its spicy cream cheese filling, this is basically a jalapeño popper in taquito form. You don’t see this everyday—I’d recommend grabbing one the next time you’re in. Probably on a pee break.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#787d50></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best 7-Eleven Hot Foods" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_7-eleven-hot-foods_inset-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Runner Up</p><strong>7-Eleven Buffalo Chicken Roller</strong><p>I have a shameful secret, guys. The week after I conducted this taste test, I went back to 7-Eleven, multiple times, to buy the Buffalo Chicken Roller on my own dime, for my own enjoyment. That isn’t to say you should be ashamed of eating 7-Eleven food on the regular—I’m just saying, only days prior was I scarfing down all their hot food in one sitting. I thought it would be hard to set foot inside the store again. But that’s the beauty of the 7-Eleven Buffalo Chicken Roller. It’s so simple—just a spicy buffalo coating over juicy chicken, with a little bit of melted cheese inside—yet so ingenious.&nbsp;These are seriously addictive, so watch out!</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#6e7d52></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best 7-Eleven Hot Foods" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_7-eleven-hot-foods_inset-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>7-Eleven Spicy Bite Hot Dog</strong><p>“This is actually really good,” manager editor <a href=#>Gwynedd Stuart</a> said when she took a bite of this 7-Eleven hot dog. I know that doesn’t sound like the ringing endorsement we usually give to our #1 ranked products, but what she means is, this 7-Eleven hot dog is actually, like, really, really good. It’s spicy and salty, with savory juices sealed into every bite. Seriously, if you told me this was from a trendy L.A. food truck, I would believe you. You can see orange pepper flakes and seasonings in the meat. It’s also completely obscene in that it’s approximately twice the size of a normal hot dog. Who knew 7-Eleven hot dogs were novelty hot dogs? Not me, that’s for sure! Maybe, just maybe, my suffering was worth it.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other 7-Eleven hot foods we tried: </strong>7-Eleven Pepperoni Pizza, 7-Eleven Steak & Cheese Taquito, 7-Eleven Taco & Cheese Taquito, 7-Eleven Cheese Pizza, 7-Eleven Breaded Boneless Chicken Wings, 7-Eleven Pepperoni Pizza Taquito, 7-Eleven Cheeseburger Bite With Bun</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFug4yeo56ulaN6p7vOnWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./galarica-cuff.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Galarica Cuff - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shaquem-griffin-biography-age-hand-parents-team-stats-and-salary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shaquem Griffin Biography, Age, Hand, Parents, Team, Stats and Salary</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
