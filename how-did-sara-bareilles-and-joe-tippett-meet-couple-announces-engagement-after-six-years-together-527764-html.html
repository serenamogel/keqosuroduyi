The post held a sweet caption that said, in part, the effect he has had on her. It said:</p><p>“The more I know you the more I know I love you…and you have introduced me to parts of myself I was afraid to love. And now I love ME more because of you. So really this is all about me.”<br>She continued:</p><p>“Just kidding. What a gift you are. Let the games begin. Onward into absolutely everything with you. ❤️”</p><p>Sara Bareilles famously wrote the music and lyrics for the Waitress musical, which went on to be nominated for four Tony Awards in 2016. She first met Joe Tippett when he auditioned for a role in a workshop for Waitress in 2015 at the American Repertory Theater near Boston. He ended up being cast in the production in the role of Earl.</p><p>Tippett, however, did not follow the Waitress team onto Broadway. He joined the cast in 2017 after his now fiance finished her run on the show. Following the break due to the COVID 19 pandemic, Joe and Sara reprsied their roles as Earl and Jenna.</p><p>The duo began dating in September 2016 according to her anniversary posts. They began making public appearances in 2017, and Bareilles even gushed about how the Broadway show brought them together.</p><p>The pair have been living together for the past few years and Sara Bareilles had mentioned that this was a big deal on her part as she had never lived with a partner before. Bareilles even highlighted how lucky she was to have Tippett as a partner as he cared for her while she was recovering from Covid in July 2020. She said:</p><p>“He did a good job taking care of me. He was a good friend and companion through all of that.”</p><p><br>On the third year anniversary of dating, Bareilles took to Instagram to share their relationship by saying, “Three years. Feels like three hundred! Can’t wait for it to be forever,” which quickly had fans speculating on whether the duo were engaged. Sara replied to the curious minds by saying they were just “in love.”</p><p>In early 2022, Sara Bareilles and Joe Tippett adopted a little dog and named him Louie, creating a small family for themselves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcLGrqCdnaSeuqZ6wqikaKiVpL2tsY6hprBllJ6xbr%2FAq5hmmpGnsqq4y56qZpmemXqru8Rmq6KooJrBtXnMnpytZZOkwrG4xGaYp6afqruksdJmnKefkZyyrrHNrWSanqSav26%2FyLFksp2Rp8BuwM6gnK2glad6dn6WcG1tZpipuq0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-trader-joes-fall-pasta.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Trader Joes Fall Food to Buy for Dinner</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keith-gattis-accident-country-musician-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Country Musician Death And Obituary</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
