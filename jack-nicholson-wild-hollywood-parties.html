And his home had the reputation as the wildest house in Hollywood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Genius.” “Difficult.” “Blunt.” “Party animal.” And “lothario.” These are all adjectives that have been used to describe Nicholson by both the press and his associates over the years. Even in his eighth decade, a bad-boy aura still sticks to the actor, despite his now living a quiet life out of the spotlight.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Nicholson admits to enjoying the “simple pleasures of life”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nicholson is the first to admit much of what makes up his Hollywood legend is true — at least to some degree. He revealed to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/talking-with-jack-nicholson-for-rolling-stones-40th-anniversary-237270/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> that he doesn’t remember hanging out with the Beatles and Bob Dylan in the sixties: “I saw this documentary with a scene of me and the Beatles out in Malibu, and I just couldn’t remember it. Of course, I could tell from the film I was a bit loaded—and no doubt about that…”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the same interview, he also defended his liberalism, partying and womanizing, saying: “Free love is usually the root and the vitality of the movement. Once you deny that normal, simple, organic sexual flow, the country is going to move right.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And denying himself what he refers to as the “simple pleasures of life” is something Nicholson never appeared to struggle with. Especially at the peak of his career in the 1970s and 1980s. “I do entertain a lot, but run a pretty tough policy. I’ve never had a party of mine crashed,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-hollywood-heavyweight-vol-14-no-4/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nicholson said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nicholson said</a> in 1980. “To be successful, a party has to have a completely private atmosphere.”</p><img alt="tuesday weld and jack nicholson at a reception in new york city in october 1971" title="Tuesday Weld and Jack Nicholson at a reception in New York City in October 1971" width=2784 height=3424 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actress-tuesday-weld-and-jack-nicholson-at-a-reception-prior-to-the-world-premiere-of-the-film-a-safe-place-lincoln-center-nyc-photo-dated-oct-15-1971.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Actress Tuesday Weld and Jack Nicholson at a reception in New York City in October 1971</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The actor’s parties were around-the-clock</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to author Marc Eliot’s unauthorized biography Nicholson, the actor’s Hollywood Hills home was the site of a seemingly continuous bacchanal. “There was round-the-clock partying, drinks, drugs, sex, lots of tea (the smoking kind), and beautiful, hot, willing girls who loved to get just as high as the boys and have a good time,” Eliot writes, adding the refrigerator was often empty except for milk, beer and pot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Eliot writes that Nicholson and his former roommate, actor Harry Dean Stanton, were notorious for the nonstop party at their shared abode and then afterward at their individual addresses. Even so, Eliot notes, in the early days of their friendship Nicholson was just as focused on making it in Hollywood: “Most of the time, though, while the action was hot and heavy in the other rooms, Jack would prefer to sit alone, in his bedroom, furiously pounding out his screenplay.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Once he had attained his Hollywood success, Nicholson purchased a party pad next door to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/marlon-brando data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marlon Brando" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marlon Brando</a> and began to fill his home with impressive artwork—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/rene-magritte data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Magritte class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Magritte</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/pablo-picasso data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Picasso class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Picasso</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/henri-matisse data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Matisse class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Matisse</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/auguste-rodin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Rodin class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rodin</a>—and according to Eliot, drugs.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Nicholson would often use cocaine and smoke marijuana</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following director <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/roman-polanski data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Roman Polanski" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Roman Polanski</a>’s alleged rape of a teen at Nicholson’s home in 1977, police found hashish in the upstairs master bedroom. “Fortunately, the rest of Jack’s ample stash of drugs was so well hidden in shaving cream containers and the like, the police missed it,” Eliot writes.

When questioned whether Nicholson was a regular cocaine user at the time, Huston replied, “Very much so. Never took overt amounts, he was never a guzzler.

I think that is average for an American… I don’t advocate anything for anybody. But I choose always to be candid because I don’t like the closet atmosphere of drugging.”</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Nicholson’s been described as a “highly sexed individual”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kim Basinger once famously described Nicholson as “the most highly sexed individual I have ever met.” His friend <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/cher data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Cher class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cher</a> remarked, “The thing about Jack is that he likes women more than any man I’ve ever known.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nicholson has been married only once, to Sandra Knight, from 1961 to 1966.
