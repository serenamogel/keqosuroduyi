A kind of heedless zeal transforms its horrors. The movie is not merely disgusting, but has an attitude and a subversive sense of humor. Its actors venture into camp satire, but never seem to know it's funny; their sincerity gives the jokes a kind of solemn gallows cackle. Consider the fact that it's about a depraved family of mass murderers who name themselves after Groucho Marx characters (Otis P. Driftwood, Rufus T. Firefly, Captain Spaulding) and that the sheriff calls in a film critic to give him insights into their pathology.</p><p>The critic is such a Groucho fan that he knows Groucho played God in Otto Preminger's "<a href=#>Skidoo</a>" (1968), something I also knew, but I bet you didn't. The sheriff wants to bring in Groucho for questioning, but the critic knows he died in 1977. "Elvis died three days earlier and stole all the headlines," he moans, risking death at the hands of the sheriff department's Elvis fans.</p><p>"The Devil's Rejects" has been written and directed by <a href=#>Rob Zombie</a> (also known as Robert Cummings and Robert Wolfgang Zombie), a composer and music video producer whose "The House of 1,000 Corpses" (2003) was a "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" wannabe. Pause for a moment to meditate on the phrase "A 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' wannabe," and you will begin to form some idea of Zombie's artistic vision. Now give him credit, in this movie, not for transcending "Chainsaw Massacre" but for sidestepping its temptations and opening up a mordantly funny approach to the material. There is actually some good writing and acting going on here, if you can step back from the material enough to see it.</p><p>The film opens with a 1978 police assault on an isolated farmhouse where, we learn, 75 murders have taken place. Inside the house, the Firefly family armors itself with steel masks and vests, and shoots it out with the sheriff (<a href=#>William Forsythe</a>). He is a hard-bitten, vengeful man who cheerfully informs a deputy to be cautious, or he'll be "cold-slabbed, toe-tagged, and mailed to your mom in a plastic bag."</p><p>Mother Firefly (<a href=#>Leslie Easterbrook</a>) is captured in the raid, but Otis (<a href=#>Bill Moseley</a>) and his sister Baby (<a href=#>Sheri Moon Zombie</a>) escape through a storm sewer (odd, in the Texas desert) and meet up with their father, Captain Spaulding (<a href=#>Sid Haig</a>). He is a man whose teeth are so bad, they're more frightening than his clown makeup. He plays such a thoroughly disgusting person, indeed, that I was driven to <i><i>www.sidhaig.com </i></i>to discover that in real life Sid looks, well, presentable, and even played a judge in Tarantino's "<a href=#>Jackie Brown</a>." This was a relief to me, because anyone who really looked like Captain Spaulding would send shoppers screaming from the Wal-Mart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55llJrDqrjSZqmeopWYwbR5kWlnbg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vicki-lawrence-shares-betty-whites-last-words-and-sweet-memories-with-her-friend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vicki Lawrence shares Betty Whites last words and sweet memories with her friend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./susan-wojcicki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Susan Wojcicki Age, Net worth: Wife, Bio-Wiki, Kids, Weight</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
