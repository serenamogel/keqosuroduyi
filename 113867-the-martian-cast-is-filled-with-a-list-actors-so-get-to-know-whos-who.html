The IMDb page for the film is essentially a hotlist of actors, from Matt Damon to Jessica Chastain to Jeff Daniels. Usually, a cast with this many A-list names raises some eyebrows, with some assuming it's just stunt casting. Yet not this film — <a href=# class=T3D><i>The Martian</i> cast</a> is allowed to use their talents to the fullest extents, and they make for some serious entertainment. In other words, they aren't there just to look pretty.</p><p>The film's cast is huge for a very good reason — the movie is about a space crew and NASA trying to save a man stranded on Mars, and you need a very strong ensemble to pull that off. Like the real-life NASA, there are plenty of moving parts needed to deal with trouble in space, so it just makes sense that the movie employs what feels like every famous actor on the planet. And they're all used wisely; in <a href=# class=T3D><i>The Martian,</i> no actor is left in the background</a> chewing scenery. Scott manages to wow viewers with the way he juggles the characters and makes each role as important as the next. It recalls other great ensemble movies like <i>The Poseidon Adventure, MASH, Ocean's Eleven </i>and<i> Traffic.</i></p><p></p><p>Here is the complete squad of actors that make <i>The Martian</i> the Hollywood spectacle it's destined to be. Minor <b>spoilers</b> to follow!</p><h3>1. Matt Damon As Mark Watney</h3><p>You could consider him the "star" of the movie, but he isn't a camera hog. It doesn't seem like the "Matt Damon Show." He's also one of many people on this list with a comic book movie connection. Although he is not directly in a comic book movie (yet), his BFF, Ben Affleck, is the next Batman.</p><h3>2. Jessica Chastain As Commander Lewis</h3><p>The <i>Zero Dark Thirty </i>star is the leader of the space pack. She has a passion for disco music (which is a running joke throughout the entire movie). Her comic book connection? She <a href=# class=T3D>has been rumored to play Captain Marve</a>l.</p><h3>3. Chiwetel Ejiofor As Dr. Vincent Kapoor</h3><p>The Academy Award nominee plays the doctor leading the charge on Earth to get Watney home. You can also see him stepping into the Marvel Cinematic Universe <a href=# class=T3D>in the forthcoming </a><i><a href=# class=T3D>Doctor Strange</a>.</i></p><h3>4. Jeff Daniels As Teddy Sanders</h3><p>His part as the tough-as-nails head of NASA reflects his role on <i>The Newsroom.</i></p><h3>5. Sean Bean As Mitch Henderson</h3><p>We know him as the late Eddard Stark, but in <i>The Martian </i>he's the flight director — and unlike his <i>Game of Thrones </i>character (and many past roles he has played), he survives!</p><h3>6. Kristen Wiig As Annie Montrose</h3><p>The former <i>Saturday Night Live </i>cast member shows her acting versatility as NASA's head of public relations.</p><h3>7. Donald Glover As Rich Purnell</h3><p>He can rap, act, and in <i>The Martian</i>, he is a super genius who practically saves the whole mission.</p><h3>8. Michael Pena As Rick Martinez</h3><p>You enjoyed him in <i>Ant-Man, </i>and now you'll enjoy him even more as the crew's pilot.</p><h3>9. Aksel Hennie As Alex Vogel</h3><p>We'll probably see more of the Norwegian actor after his role as the resident chemist of Watney's crew.</p><h3>10. Sebastian Stan As Chris Beck</h3><p>Yup. That's the Winter Soldier playing the crew's flight surgeon. You probably didn't recognize him without his silver super-arm.</p><h3>11. Kate Mara As Beth Johanssen</h3><p>If you couldn't get enough comic book connections, here's another one for you. <i>Fantastic Four</i>'s Invisible Woman plays the resident tech wiz.</p><p>With a cast as star-studded (and super-powered) as this, it's no wonder <i>The</i> <i>Martian</i> is poised to be one of fall's best blockbusters.</p><p><i>Images: Twentieth Century Fox, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Giphy</a> (11)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfZJxbXBlpJ2ybrnAq6uimZ5isKK%2F02agrGWWnrmtscNmrqKsmGKubrjIrKtmmZOpvLO%2FjKymZp%2BVqXq1u4ykpaivXay1sL%2BMsJ%2Bo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./keke-palmer-baby-daddy-drama.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Keke Palmer Kills Baby Daddy Drama With Diss Track &amp;amp; Merch</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-noemi-ferre-meet-sepp-kuss-cyclist-girlfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Noemi Ferr?
