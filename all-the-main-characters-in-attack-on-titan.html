These are some of the most important characters within Attack on Titan, but be careful because there are spoilers ahead.</p><h2 id=h-eren-jaeger data-injectable=false>Eren Jaeger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/attack-on-titan-final-season.jpg><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true>Eren Jaeger is the main character for the majority of the show and host to the titular Attack Titan. After losing his mother during the Titan siege of Wall Maria and his father at a later point, Eren joins the Survey Corps in hopes of getting his revenge on the Titans. Throughout the seasons of the show Eren’s character grows substantially as secrets are revealed not only about his Attack Titan, but the other titans and the history of their kind.</p><h2 id=h-armin-arlert data-injectable=false>Armin Arlert</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attack-on-titan-armin.jpg><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>The best friend of Eren, Armin plays an important role in the show. While he isn’t the most skilled combatant, Armin’s strategic skill and tuned mind make him a great asset to the Survey Corps. Later in the show’s run, Armin receives the power of the Colossal titan, making him even more impactful during battle situations, and a greater player in the overall story of Attack on Titan.</p><h2 id=h-mikasa-ackermann data-injectable=false>Mikasa Ackermann</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/attack-on-titan-mikasa.jpg><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>Another of Eren’s closest friends and part of the legendary Ackermann bloodline, Mikasa is one of the most skilled fighters in the show. Her mastery of Omni-Directional mobility gear and skill with a sword makes her one of the most valuable assets to the Survey Corps when she joins with Eren and Armin. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mikasa caps off the trio</a> that make up the key characters in Attack on Titan.</p><h2 id=h-levi-ackermann data-injectable=false>Levi Ackermann</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FE7CD084-9592-46AD-ABA3-2DFD0489CA9E.jpeg><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>Being an Ackermann himself, it shouldn’t be a surprise that Levi is also one of the most gifted fighters in the show with skills both wielding blades and traversing using Omni-Directional mobility gear. Levi is the captain of the special operations squad within the Survey Corps, commanding a team of soldiers to carry out some of the most dangerous missions. He also just happens to be the most popular character in the show simply because he is so cool.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Zeke Yeager</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attack-on-titan-zeke.jpg><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>Zeke Yeager might be the big villain of Attack on Titan depending on how you interpret the show’s unique story. A long lost brother to our protagonist Eren, Zeke also happens to be the host for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Beast Titan</a>, and someone who has a lot of knowledge about the Titans’ history. With this knowledge, Zeke has quite a plan he is attempting to set in motion, which basically makes up the entire plot of Attack on Titan.</p><h2 id=h-bertold-hoover data-injectable=false>Bertold Hoover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bertold-Attack-on-Titan.jpg><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>At the beginning of the series, it seems that Bertold Hoover is simply another recruit for the Survey Corps training alongside our main cast, but later his identity as the Colossal Titan is revealed. The Colossal Titan is the very first titan we see in the show and the first significant threat that those behind the walls encounter.</p><h2 id=h-reiner-braun data-injectable=false>Reiner Braun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attack-on-titan-reiner.jpg><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>Similar to Bertold, Reiner Braun comes to the Survey Corps along and reveals his identity as the Armroed TItan. While the two of them do become villainous figures, once the secrets of the Titans are revealed, the motivation behind their actions becomes more clear.</p><h2 id=h-annie-leonhart data-injectable=false>Annie Leonhart</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/attack-on-titan-annie-1.jpg><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=735 data-injectable=true>Along with Bertold and Reiner, Annie Leonhart came to the island, however, her path splintered off slightly with with her choice to join the Military Police Brigade instead of the Survey Corps. Annie is the Female Titan and one of the early threats during the first season of the show. While she may be out of the picture for quite a bit of the series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her significance is important</a> in both the beginning and final seasons of the show.</p><h2 id=h-historia-reiss data-injectable=false>Historia Reiss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attack-on-titan-historia.jpg><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>Historia is one of the more unique characters within Attack on Titan as she isn’t directly involved in front-line combat. However, she was born to royalty and is deeply connected to both the history of the Titans and the history of the walls, so you can see why she’s one of the core cast members. Later in the show, she is the final remaining member of the Reiss Royal Family and assumes a leadership position among the people within the walls.</p><h2 id=h-erwin-smith data-injectable=false>Erwin Smith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attack-on-titan-erwin.jpg><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Erwin Smith is one of the first leaders we met within the show, and commander of the Survey Corps. Once our main three characters join the team we see quite a bit of Erwin, his morals, and how he commands his team.</p><h2 id=h-hange-zoe data-injectable=false>Hange Zoe</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/attack-on-titan-hange.jpg><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=false>Formerly a squad leader, after the passing of Erwin, Hange Zoe takes over as the 14th commander of the Survey Corps. Much like Erwin, possibly even more so, Hange is a genius tactician and science expert who is not only a valuable leader to the Survey Corps, but a helpful companion for Eren while he is coming to terms with his Attack Titan powers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiuMtmq6GdXaKuqrqMnJ%2BaqpGYwaa%2B0magp2WRqcGir8pmpqdlpJ7BorqO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./exclusive-akira-akbar-on-bel-air-passion-and-telling-ashleys-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Exclusive: Akira Akbar on Bel-Air, passion, and telling Ashleys story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./louis-cole-net-worth-165283.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Louis Cole Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
