Greg Malarik, her husband, was tried twice for the crime, but her murder has never been solved. Malarik’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">true-crime</a></strong> case is now the topic of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Dateline NBC episode, “The Sleepover</a>.”</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>The night when Malarik vanished, her family was having a sleepover with Sherri’s sister’s children. Malarik and her husband, Greg, had several young kids, while Greg and Sherri also had children from previous relationships. The Malarik household was likely filled with the cheerful voices of children when Sherri stepped outside to speak with her husband, Greg, who was busy outdoors, tinkering with the family minivan.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>The next day, Sherri’s brother-in-law found her body in the vehicle <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">parked at a Winn-Dixie</a>, a grocery store chain in that area. She’d been shot twice with a .25-caliber gun, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News</a> reported.</p><h2 id=h-greg-mararik-s-mistress data-injectable=false>Greg Mararik’s mistress</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>via Dateline NBC/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>During the investigation into Sherri Malarik’s death, her son, Jason, who was then 11 years old, recalled Greg Malarik telling him his mom left to run an errand at the grocery store before Greg got in the shower. That night, Jennifer Spohn stopped by the Malarik’s house. Spohn was later revealed to be Greg’s mistress. She later said the timing of her visit to the home the night Sherri disappeared was a coincidence. Spohn said she needed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to return a lawnmower she had borrowed from the family</a>.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Spohn was naturally a suspect in the case but was never arrested for Sherri’s murder. No one was, in fact, until nearly twenty years after Sherri died, in 2020, when Greg, Sherri’s husband, was finally taken into custody.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Spohn revealed secrets</h2><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Although Jennifer Spohn is not believed to have murdered Sherri Malarik, something she told the police played a part in Greg’s arrest. In a conversation, she admitted to the authorities that Greg, who had been divorced before, said it would be easier just to kill Sherri than to go through that again.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>While Spohn insisted that could never happen, still, Spohn said she helped drive Greg from the Winn-Dixie parking lot where Sherri was later found, dispose of evidence, including the gun, and timed the knock on the door with the lawnmower to help provide Greg an alibi. Greg and Spohn, meanwhile, were romantically involved for years after Sherri’s death.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Greg Malarik’s trials</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Untitled-design-72.png><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>Over the years, the Malarik children developed suspicions of their own about what happened to their mother when she disappeared and was later found dead. Some of the children thought their father killed her, while others believed Spohn was more involved than she let on.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=false>Greg Malarik stood trial for the first time in 2022, but there was a mistrial. In 2023, Greg was tried again, but that trial, too, had its issues. In 2023, Greg was declared not guilty of Malarik’s shooting death, and her murder remains unsolved to this day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX5mutbHLoqWeZaedrrV5x5qnqZ2emrFuwM5mqqGdoqe2brnApZiroZtirq%2BwjLCfqGWbnrmtscNmn56qXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./category-pok-c3-a9mon-by-type.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Category:Pokmon by type - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-guarinis-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Guarinis Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
