(The pair broke up and Josh married Anna Keller in 2008.)</p><p>Jill further detailed how she felt pressured by her family to appear on their TLC reality show for longer than she wanted to.&nbsp;</p><p>She said that, before her 2014 wedding, “I just saw the signature page. It was like on the end of the kitchen table — like, ‘Hey, I just needed you guys to sign these,’” Jill said. “We were literally running through the kitchen, and it was like whoever you could grab on the way through.
