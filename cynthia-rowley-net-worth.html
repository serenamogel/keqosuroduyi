She’s been active in the industry since 1981, having also released several books and made guest appearances on television, so all of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Cynthia Rowley? As of mid-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $50 million, mostly earned through success in the fashion industry. She’s released numerous collections, and has collaborated with various companies. She’s also released exclusive collections, and as she continues her career, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Cynthia Rowley Net Worth $50 million</h3><p>At a young age, Cynthia would show her interests in fashion design, creating her first dress, partly because she came from an artistically inclined family. She attended Barrington High School and matriculated in 1976, and afterwards attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p>After graduating in 1981, Rowley was awarded an SAIC fellowship, which enabled her to relocate to New York City, where she started to pursue her career in fashion, and subsequently organize her own fashion shows. In the late ‘80s, she launched her first capsule collection, including women’s wear, home furnishings, and accessories, partnering with Staples department stores. She continued to improve her craft, and so her net worth also started to grow. In 1998, she created her first menswear collection, and also released the women’s secondary line called “Rowley by Cynthia Rowley”. She started doing more collaborative work too, and in 2009 it was reported that she would be redesigning the uniforms for United Airlines, however, the deal eventually fell off. She then started working on the menswear collection called “Mr. Powers”.</p><p>Cynthia’s endeavors help her continuously grow her net worth. She presents fashion shows at the New York Fashion Week, and now has stores all over the world. She’s received a lot of praise for her work from high profile publications such as The New York Times, and has won the Legend of Fashion award from the SAIC, and in 2015 won the Designer of the Year Award from the American Apparel and Footwear Association American Image Awards. Early in her career, she was also honored with the Perry Ellis Award for New Fashion Talent from The Council of Fashion Designers of America.</p><p>Rowley has also appeared in various television programs, mainly on fashion-related shows such as “America’s Next Top Model” and “Project Runway”. She’s also made guest appearances in various talk shows, including the “Late Show with David Letterman”, “The Oprah Winfrey Show” and “Good Morning America”. The television show “Return to Amish” also featured Rowley’s design company.</p><p>Cynthia has also written several books over the course of her career, including “Swell Holiday”, “Home Swell Home”, and “Slim: A Fantasy Memoir”, improving further her net worth.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Cynthia married interior designer William Keenan in 1996 and they have a daughter, however, their marriage ended in divorce. In 2005, she married art dealer William Powers, and they also have a daughter; they reside in New York City.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<p><a href=# class="shortc-button medium green"><span class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden=true></span> All pictures</a></p><h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Tilt-A-Whirl</td><td>1995</td><td>producer</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Thanks <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=thanks readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>It's So Audrey!
