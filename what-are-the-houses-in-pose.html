Right from the start of the show, viewers are presented to the House Abundance, Pendavis, and Evangelista. While Pose is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a fictional TV series</a>, its events are all highly based on real life, making it more of a history piece than a drama. Without New York’s ballroom scene, drag wouldn’t exist as we know it.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>Interested in learning more about Pose’s Houses? Here’s what they are and their history.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>Creating your own family</strong></h3><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>In Pose’s pilot, Blanca Rodriguez abandons her original House of Abundance headed by Elektra to create her own House of Evangelista and become a mother. You’ll notice how the members of the House refer to each other as children and mother, but they are clearly not related. Not biologically, anyway. The Houses are the equivalent of a family, not of blood, but of empathy. Blanca recruits Damon Richards, who was homeless after being thrown out of his home for being gay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pose-Houses-Real-640x360.jpeg><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>The Houses in Pose are made of people who were rejected by their original family for being part of the LGBTQ+ community or not conforming to society’s norms. They are primarily Black and Latino. Those who can afford housing start their House, like Blanca and Elektra, and take in other homeless LGBTQ+ youths.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>In return, and as a form of showing pride of who they are, all House members perform together in balls. Each House competes against each other in different categories, like posing, fashion runaways, and challenges.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>Blanca as the House Evangelista mother encourages her house members, her children, to chase their dreams. She serves in stark contrast to Elektra, mother of House Abundance, who looks down and humiliates her children. This shows that not every House is the same, nor are they all a safe refuge for its children.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>While Pose’s story mainly focuses on the Houses Abundance and Evangelista, there are other ones that make an appearance or are mentioned during the show. Here are all the Houses seen in Pose:</p><ul data-current-count=463.5 data-injectable=true><li>House Abundance</li><li>House Evangelista</li><li>House Ferocity</li><li>House Khan</li><li>House Mugler</li><li>House Pendavis</li><li>House Wintour</li><li>House Xtravaganza</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>Are there Houses in real life?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pose-Houses-670x314.jpeg><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Pose is heavily inspired by Jennie Livingston’s Paris is Burning, an iconic LGBTQ documentary which beautifully depicts New York City’s ballroom scene during the 1980s. The House Xtravaganza from Pose is based on the real House Xtravaganza that appeared in the documentary.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>Nearly half a century later, the problems Pose looks at remain rampant in American society. A <a href=#>study</a> from Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago from 2017 reports LGBTQ youth are 120 percent more likely to experience homelessness than non-LGBTQ youth.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>Back in the ’80s, there were only a few organizations and service providers dedicated to helping young LGBTQ New Yorkers, so there were no other people but themselves to help each other stay out of the streets. Now the community has many other ways of finding shelter and support, even though the problem persists.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>The True Colors Fund, for example, is a nonprofit organization working to end homelessness in the LGBTQ community. According to it, there are <a href=#>1.6 million</a> youth who are homeless each year, and up to 40 percent of them identify as LGBTQ. However, LGBTQ youth represent only seven-percent of the total youth population, highlighting a huge disproportion of homelessness among these populations.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>Where could we find Houses in the U.S.?</strong></h3><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>Houses could be found mostly in northeast cities in the U.S., like in New York City, Newark, Jersey City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and Oakland, California. Here are a few notable Houses:</p><ul data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true><li>The House of Aviance — founded by Mother Juan Aviance.</li><li>The House of Xtravaganza — founded by Hector Valle, and chiefly run by Hector Xtravaganza and Angie Xtravaganza in the 1980s.</li><li>The House of LaBeija — founded by Crystal LaBeija, and chiefly run by Pepper LaBeija in the 1980s and 1990s.</li><li>The House of Dupree — founded by Paris Dupree.</li><li>The House of Ninja — founded by Willi Ninja.</li><li>The House of Mugler — founded by David, Raleigh and Julian.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>Houses in drag</strong></h3><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>As time passed, Houses became common for drag families. Mother and fathers became drag mothers and drag fathers, and so did their House children. You’ll hear in RuPaul’s Drag Race, for example, that drag queens receive the same last stage name of the drag queen that first put them in drag. Granted, that’s not always the case. But House culture gave birth to the contemporary drag scene, and Pose reveals the need for this beautiful, extravagant form of expression in the first place.</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=73 data-injectable=false>Today, the culture has changed, but the empathy and camaraderie persists.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJqqlWLBqbGMoaauq5Woeqq6jKmmrJ1f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./delia-lisette-chambers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Delia Lisette Chambers movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./irene-cara-cause-of-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Irene Cara Cause of Death: The Singer Was Found Dead At Her Home</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-encourages-people-not-to-get-face-tattoos.html>Kevin Gates Encourages People Not to Get Face Tattoos</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-karra-elejalde-wife-silvia-bel.html>Meet Karra Elejalde Wife Slvia Bel?
